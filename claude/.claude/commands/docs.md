Write or update documentation in the /docs directory. Before writing:

1. Understand what needs to be documented (feature, API, architecture, guide, etc.)
2. Review existing documentation structure and style
3. Determine the best format (markdown, API specs, diagrams, etc.)
4. Identify which documentation files need to be created or updated (check for existing `docs/`, `documentation/`, or similar directories; if none exist, ask the user where to put them)
5. Present a plan for approval
6. Write concise, implementation-focused documentation

IMPORTANT: Documentation should focus ONLY on implementation details and code flow. Exclude:
- Commands to run processes (these belong in README)
- Operational/troubleshooting guides
- Configuration details unless critical to understanding code flow
- Future enhancements or product planning
- Setup or environment instructions

Keep documentation as concise as possible while maintaining clarity.
